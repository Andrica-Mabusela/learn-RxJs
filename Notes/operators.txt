# Most operator takes in Observable as input and output will also be an observable

# An operator is a pure function

What is a pure function?
* A function that returns the same output value when given the same input value.
* Has no side effects.

# We have operators for below functioning

* Creation
* Mathematical
* Join
* Transformation
* Utitlity
* Conditional
* multicasting
* Error handling


## 1. Of operator

=> make observable from a string or array or an object


## 2. from operator
=> from operator will create an observable from an array, an array-like object, a promise, an iterable object, or an observable-like object.


## What is the difference between of and from operator
=> Both of and from operators are creation operators
=> from operator will create an observable from an array, an array-like object, a promise, an iterable object, or an observable-like object
=> of operator can create an observable from a string, object or array. and is especially useful when working with models or interfaces.



## fromEvent Operator
=> capture an event and pass it as an observable.
=> Creates an Observable that emits events of a specific type coming from the given event target.
=> We can bind target elements and methods to make sure we get Observable as output.
=> Angular specific -> we will use ViewChild, NativeElement as target element and bind events.
